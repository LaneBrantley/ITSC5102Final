# ITSC5102Final

This is Lane Brantley's final project for ITSC 5102. This project is a small C++ program which simulates a bank app. The program is ran through the terminal, allowing for the user to give input and direct the logic of the program. The program is ran in main.cpp from the main() function. The Customer.cpp file is the file which contains the code for the Customer class and the attributed methods. main() calls the mainProgram() method, which works through logging in, including password verification, and what the user would like to do while in the app. Thank you!
